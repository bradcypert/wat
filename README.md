wat is a simple binary that fetches a commit message from http://www.whatthecommit.com and commits in the current directory with that message.

Need an example?

#### Installation
To install, you have two options. If you're using rust try `cargo install wat`.

If you're on a unix machine, you can grab the binary from the releases tab and add that to your path.


#### Building from sauce
Want to contribute? I can't blame you. This is built in rust, so you'll need rust installed first. Got it? Good.
Now, you can clone the repository and use `cargo build` to build it and `cargo run` to build & run it.
